We will be using colorful coding blocks the fit together like puzzle pieces along with digital paint tools to create a story (make your own cartoon) using Scratch programming language. Next, you will learn how to create a math video game with +, -, x, / while learning about loops, conditionals and variables. Then, you will learn how to create your own video game! You will all be coding your own stories and game while sharing ideas with your friends as you go! Ages 8-13</p>

              Enhancing Storytelling Through Code

              This course will focus on learning how to bring a story to animated life through code. Ideas for the implementation of coding will be discussed. Your child will learn new coding skills in a whole group setting in the computer lab. Questions will be discussed and then they will think of a story (fiction or non-fiction) and practice using the coding skills in pairs/small groups in the computer lab with instructor support.

              We will be using the following free website: scratch.mit.edu. Scratch was developed with children in mind. Colorful blocks fit together to carry out various child-friendly functions. A classroom curriculum guide will be provided with pictures of the coding blocks along with free access to a video curriculum guide for you and your child to access for free after the course is over. (https://www.udemy.com/coding-for-kids/learn/#/)

              We will cover the following skills:

              <h3>On Day 3</h3>
              We will make final edits and share our stories with peers. Then, we will learn how to create a video game using +, -, x and / learning about loops, conditionals and variables.
            </p>

            <p>
              <h3>On Day 4</h3>
              The children will continue working on their math video game and then learn how to create a video game similar to the original Mario Brothers.
            </p>

            <p>
              <h3>On Day 5</h3>
              Your child will add new levels to their video game and then we will have time for everyone to play games arcade style for the last half of the class.
